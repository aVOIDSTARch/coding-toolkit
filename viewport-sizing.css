/* Reset default margins and padding */  
html, body {  
  margin: 0;  
  padding: 0;  
}  

/* Include padding and borders in element sizes */  
* {  
  box-sizing: border-box;  
}  

/* Now, if you set a div to width: 100%, its padding and borders won’t make it wider than the screen. */

Unit	Description
vw	    1% of the viewport’s width
vh	    1% of the viewport’s height
dvh	    Dynamic viewport height (ignores           mobile address bars)
vw	    1% of viewport width (consistent across devices)

/* viewport full height '100vh' */

body {  
  height: 100vh; /* 100% of viewport height */  
} 

/* For Mobile browsers */

body {  
  height: 100dvh; /* Dynamic viewport height (modern browsers) */  
}

/* Fix 2: Shrink Content to Fit#

A better approach is to ensure content fits within the viewport. Use these techniques:

Responsive Text: Use clamp() for dynamic font sizes (e.g., font-size: clamp(1rem, 4vw, 2.5rem)).

Limit Width: For text-heavy content, set max-width on containers to prevent overly wide lines on large screens: */

.content {  
  max-width: 800px; /* Narrower content on big screens */  
  margin: 0 auto; /* Center content */  
  padding: 20px; /* Add padding without overflow */  
}  

/* Adjust Spacing: Reduce excessive margin or padding that pushes content beyond the viewport. */

/* Make Images Responsive#

Use max-width: 100% to ensure images never exceed their container’s width. Pair with height: auto to preserve aspect ratio: */

img {  
  max-width: 100%; /* Image scales down on small screens */  
  height: auto; /* Prevents distortion */
}  

/* Cover the Viewport Without Distortion#

To make an image span the full viewport (e.g., a hero background), use object-fit: cover with width: 100vw and height: 100dvh: */

.hero-image {  
  width: 100vw; /* Full viewport width */  
  height: 100dvh; /* Full viewport height */  
  object-fit: cover; /* Crop image to fill space (no distortion) */  
  object-position: center; /* Center the image */  
}  

/* object-fit: cover ensures the image fills the container without stretching—ideal for background images! */

/* Example 1: Flexbox for Vertical Layout#

Use Flexbox to split the viewport into sections (e.g., header, content, footer) that fit exactly: */

<body>  
  <header>Header</header>  
  <main>Main Content</main>  
  <footer>Footer</footer>  
</body>  
body {  
  height: 100dvh;  
  display: flex;  
  flex-direction: column; /* Stack elements vertically */  
  margin: 0;  
}  
 
header, footer {  
  padding: 1rem;  
  background: #333;  
  color: white;  
}  
 
main {  
  flex: 1; /* Take remaining space between header/footer */  
  padding: 1rem;  
  overflow: auto; /* Add scrollbar ONLY to main if content overflows */  
}  

/* Here, flex: 1 on <main> ensures it expands to fill the space between the header and footer, while overflow: auto lets users scroll only the main content if needed (keeping header/footer fixed). */

/* Example 2: Grid for Complex Layouts#

Grid is great for 2D layouts (rows and columns). Use grid-template-rows to define sections that fit the viewport: */

body {  
  height: 100dvh;  
  display: grid;  
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto; /* Header (auto height), main (remaining), footer (auto) */  
  margin: 0;  
}  
 
header { grid-row: 1; }  
main { grid-row: 2; overflow: auto; }  
footer { grid-row: 3; }  

/* This achieves the same result as Flexbox but with grid syntax.*/

/* Useful Datapoints */

/* The average desktop screen size in pixels for 2025 is commonly 1920×1080 (Full HD), with other popular resolutions including 1366×768 and 2560×1440. These dimensions are important for ensuring a good user experience across various devices. */

So width ranges from an avg 1366 to 2560.
Average is 1920.

/* Expert Insight: According to web development specialists, designing primarily for 1920×1080 while ensuring compatibility with 1366×768 covers approximately 61% of all desktop users globally. */

/** OPTIMIZATION **/

Image Optimization:

- Use responsive images with srcset attributes
- Implement the WebP format for better compression
- Provide different image sizes for different pixel densities
- Consider lazy loading for performance improvement

CSS Techniques:

/* Flexible grid systems */
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 1rem;
}

/* Responsive breakpoints */
@media (max-width: 768px) { /* Mobile styles */ }
@media (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px) { /* Tablet */ }
@media (min-width: 1025px) { /* Desktop */ }

Performance Considerations:

Optimize the critical rendering path for mobile-first
Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for flexible layouts
Implement progressive enhancement strategies
Monitor Core Web Vitals across different resolutions

Common Screen Resolution Mistakes to Avoid

Q: What are the biggest mistakes when dealing with screen resolutions?
A: Common pitfalls include:

- Fixed-width designs - Assuming all users have the same screen size
- Ignoring pixel density - Not accounting for high-DPI displays
- Poor breakpoint selection - Choosing arbitrary breakpoints instead of content-driven ones
- Neglecting touch interfaces - Designing only for mouse interaction
- Inadequate testing - Only testing on the designer's preferred resolution

Best Practices:

- Design mobile-first, then scale up
- Use relative units (em, rem, %) instead of fixed pixels
- Test early and often on real devices
- Consider accessibility requirements for all resolutions
- Monitor analytics to understand your audience's actual device usage
